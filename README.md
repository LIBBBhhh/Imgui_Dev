# Imgui_Dev





I want to speak about the creator of Dear Imgui, who blocked me because I’m a modder (reverse engineer), yes I am, but I haven’t released a single cheat for a long time and haven’t hacked a single serious game yet, I’m a well-mannered person with my own moral principles, but Dear Ocrount, I wanted to contribute to the imgui and not use it in cheats or somewhere else, my imgui saver would help someone, in my own defense I would like to say that not all modders are ungrateful pigs, your views are harsh


I quote the text from the demo window

```
ImGui::Text("Not for use by cheats, etc.");
```
